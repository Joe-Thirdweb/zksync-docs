thirdweb Insight is a fast, reliable and fully customizable way for developers to index, transform & query onchain data
across 30+ chains. Insight includes out-of-the-box APIs for transactions, events, tokens. Developers can also define
custom API schemas, or blueprints, without the need for ABIs, decoding, RPC, or web3 knowledge to fetch blockchain data.
